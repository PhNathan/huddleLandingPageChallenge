## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

This little challenge helped me to better understand flexbox and better develop my media query skills.

little piece of code that helped me:

logo creation : 

```html
  <header>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="logo">
              <img src="images/logo.svg" alt="logo">
            </div><!--logo-->
        </div><!--container-->
    </header>
```
Defining a container for the entire project, used in all sessions :

```css
.container{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-start;
    width: 1440px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn Grid layout, improve my flexbox even more and improve my skills with responsiveness, I intend to improve this landing page with my knowledge that I will still acquire.
